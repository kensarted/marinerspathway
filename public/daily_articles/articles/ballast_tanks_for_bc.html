<h1 class="text-4xl font-extrabold text-indigo-900 mb-6">Ballast Tanks for Bulk Carriers</h1>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-700 mb-4">Ballast Hold</h2>
<p class="bg-yellow-50 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-yellow-300 text-yellow-800 my-4">
  All bulk carriers must have ballast tanks of sufficient capacity to allow immersion of the propeller and ensure suitable trim and stability.
</p>
<p class="text-gray-800 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
  Filling the ballast hold or holds is usually optional and is undertaken to achieve the heavy ballast condition.
</p>
<p class="bg-yellow-50 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-yellow-300 text-yellow-800 my-4">
  When the hold has been cleaned as required, any blanks and cover plates must be removed from the ballast line to allow ballasting and deballasting and the bilge line must be blanked off to prevent the flooding of other compartments. (Ballast line – open, Bilge line – shut)
</p>
<p class="bg-yellow-50 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-yellow-300 text-yellow-800 my-4">
  Some classification societies prohibit ships' masters from operating their ships with ballast holds filled to between 20 percent - 70 percent of capacity, and holds if ballasted at sea should always be fully ballasted to avoid damage from sloshing. (Don’t do 20% to 70% fill, Do full fill)
</p>
<p class="text-gray-800 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
  At the commencement of the voyage, the ballast holds should be filled to the coaming with the hatch covers still open for easy observation of the filling. (During filling – open hatch cover)
</p>
<p class="text-gray-800 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
  When filling has been stopped, the hatch covers must be closed and well battened down.
</p>
<p class="bg-yellow-50 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-yellow-300 text-yellow-800 my-4">
  The ballast hatch covers on some ships are provided with four breather valves which must be open when ballast is carried. (After fill – closed)
</p>
<p class="text-gray-800 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
  Ballast holds can be used either to hold ballast or to carry cargo.
</p>
<p class="bg-yellow-50 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-yellow-300 text-yellow-800 my-4">
  When cargo is to be carried it is essential that the proper steps are taken to ensure that ballast water cannot be admitted to the hold by accident.
</p>

  <li class="bg-yellow-50 p-3 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-yellow-300 text-yellow-800 my-2">
    Bolting a watertight cover plate over the ballast suction in the hold and this may be reinforced in the engine room by fitting a blank, padlocking a valve or posting a notice. (Fix cover plates to in hold ballast section, Fit Blanks and Padlock to engine room valve and post notice)
  </li>
  <li class="bg-yellow-50 p-3 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-yellow-300 text-yellow-800 my-2">
    Blanks or cover plates which were fitted to the bilge and CO2 smothering lines must be removed, so that these systems can operate whilst cargo is being carried. (Clear the cover plates and blanks of bilge line and CO2 line before loading cargo in cargo holds)
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-700 mb-4">Port Ballast</h2>
<p class="bg-yellow-50 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-yellow-300 text-yellow-800 my-4">
  Certain large bulk carriers are equipped with some additional ballast holds which can be ballasted only in port to reduce the air-draft.
</p>
<p class="text-gray-800 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
  Such holds are not strong enough to be fully ballasted, and can only be filled to a stated level, perhaps half the capacity of the hold. The ballasting reduces the vessel's air-draft, so that the grabs and bulldozers can clear the coaming when being lifted in and out of the working holds. The ballast must be discharged from these holds before the vessel puts to sea.
</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-700 mb-4">Deballasting Sequence</h2>
<p class="bg-yellow-50 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-yellow-300 text-yellow-800 my-4">
  The deballasting sequence has already been indicated and is dictated by the requirements to limit stresses, maintain a stern trim, and an acceptable air draft.
</p>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4 text-gray-800">
  <li class="bg-yellow-50 p-3 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-yellow-300 text-yellow-800 my-2">Ballast holds, where provided and full, will be discharged first.</li>
  <li class="bg-yellow-50 p-3 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-yellow-300 text-yellow-800 my-2">Double bottom tanks will be discharged next.</li>
  <li class="bg-yellow-50 p-3 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-yellow-300 text-yellow-800 my-2">Topside tanks will be discharged after double-bottom tanks, except where stress considerations dictate that they are discharged at the same time as the adjacent double bottom tanks.</li>
  <li class="bg-yellow-50 p-3 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-yellow-300 text-yellow-800 my-2">Peak tanks will be discharged last.</li>
</ul>
<p class="bg-yellow-50 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-yellow-300 text-yellow-800 my-4">
  Within this framework, it will generally be the case that double-bottom tanks and topside tanks will be discharged when the adjacent hold is being loaded.
