    <h1>Heavy Lift Loading Precautions</h1>
    <p>As the Chief Officer, when scheduled to load a heavy lift, the following checks and precautions should be taken:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Weight and Size Verification:</strong> Determine the total weight and overall size of the load. Ensure it is within the Safe Working Load (SWL) capacity of the ship’s heavy lift derrick or crane. If the load is being handled by a floating crane or shore-side facilities, verify the facilities' capabilities at the port of discharge.</li>
        <li><strong>Load Density Plan:</strong> Check the Load Density Plan to ensure that the designated stowage space can accommodate the load in terms of both size and deck weight capacity.</li>
        <li><strong>Stability Checks:</strong> Calculate the maximum angle of heel if using the ship’s gear. Verify the GM (metacentric height) for all stages of the lift, from hoisting to landing. Consider improving GM by adding water ballast to double bottom tanks to compensate for any expected loss of apparent GM.</li>
        <li><strong>Lifting Apparatus Inspection:</strong> Inspect the slinging equipment or any special lifting apparatus intended for use. Ensure all equipment is in good condition and suitable for the load.</li>
    </ul>

        <strong>Note:</strong> Ensure all safety measures are followed and documented during the heavy lift operation to prevent accidents and maintain stability.
