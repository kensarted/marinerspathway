<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-3">Understanding Practical Navigation</h2>
<p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
  Practical Navigation is the cornerstone of safe and efficient seafaring,
  encompassing a broad range of techniques and knowledge necessary to guide a vessel
  from one point to another across oceans and along coasts.
</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-2">Key Aspects:</h3>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
  <li>
    <strong>Celestial Navigation:</strong> Utilizing celestial bodies (sun, stars, moon, planets)
    to determine a vessel's position at sea. This involves using a sextant for sights
    and performing complex calculations.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Coastal Navigation:</strong> Navigating within sight of land, relying on charts,
    landmarks, aids to navigation (like buoys and lighthouses), and precise position fixing
    methods such as bearings and distances.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Passage Planning:</strong> The comprehensive process of preparing for a voyage,
    covering appraisal of information, detailed planning (route, safety, environmental),
    execution, and continuous monitoring. This ensures compliance with COLREGs and other regulations.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Tides and Currents:</strong> Understanding and predicting the rise and fall of tides,
    and the set and drift of currents, to ensure safe clearances and optimize passage timing.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Electronic Navigation Systems:</strong> Proficient use of modern equipment like ECDIS
    (Electronic Chart Display and Information System), GPS, Radar, ARPA (Automatic Radar Plotting Aid),
    and AIS (Automatic Identification System) for enhanced situational awareness and navigation safety.
  </li>
</ul>

  Mastering these practical skills is essential for deck officers to ensure the safety
  of the vessel, crew, and cargo, while also protecting the marine environment.
